                <h2>Nelleke Strik Counselling & Psychotherapy</h2>
                <p>You may encounter a stressful event or face a challenging period in your life. You may experience low mood, suffer from a lack of motivation, or feel stuck. You may want to talk through past experiences to better understand them and see how they may still impact your current life. Being in a state of distress can affect your health and quality of life. Counselling therapy can help. I am a compassionate, experienced therapist and I offer a safe, supportive, and non-judgmental space to explore your questions with you.</p>

                <p>I have always been fascinated by human relationships and behaviours and people's unique stories and life experiences, and I am interested in all the questions related to this. I believe that caring for people's mental health is essential for their general health and wellbeing. I am passionate about helping people to create healthy fulfilling relationships and to address issues that may prevent them from this and hinder their wellbeing.</p>

                <p>I am a Registered Counselling Therapist (RCT) with the Nova Scotia College of Counselling Therapists (NSCCT) and a Certified Canadian Counsellor (CCC) with the Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association (CCPA). I obtained a Master's degree in Counselling (M.Ed.) from Acadia University. Prior to this, I completed a Master in French in Amsterdam (Netherlands) and a Master and a Ph.D. in Linguistics in Paris (France).</p>

                <p>I have over 9 years of experience in the field of counselling. I was employed at a community-based counselling agency before starting my own counselling practice. I work with people with diverse backgrounds having a wide variety of presenting issues. I have experience working with immigrants from a range of different countries, and my practice is LGBTQ+ friendly. I provide therapy in English and French, as well as Dutch.</p>

                    <h3>Approach</h3>
                    <p>I work from a humanistic approach, which is client-centred and collaborative. I use a trauma-informed lens. I have specialized training in ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, a mindfulness-based behavioural therapy), EFT (Emotionally Focused Therapy, an attachment-based approach) and IFS (Internal Family Systems, a parts-based approach), and I integrate interventions from various other frameworks.</p>

                    <p>Nelleke has a very calm and patient demeanour. I feel safe talking about and working through issues with her. When I express doubts about myself, I've really come to appreciate how she validates and reassures or adeptly reframes a situation to help me trust in myself more. I feel grateful to know she's there to support me.</p>

                    <p>After working with Nelleke for several years I can say without reservation that she has a warm, genuine approach to counseling; she provides a safe and supportive space in which to share your deepest thoughts and toughest challenges. Early on, Nelleke and I collaborated to identify my goals and desired outcomes.  As it turns out, those goals are still relevant today; and we have achieved my desired outcomes many times over. She keeps me focused and "on track", gently reminding me of the actions and patterns that no longer serve. I have a wonderfully supportive circle of friends and family, but without reservation, I can honestly say that Nelleke is at the centre of that circle.</p>

                    <p>I have been attending weekly sessions with Nelleke for a year, and during this time I have begun to create a life for myself where my needs and values are at the forefront of my decision making. I highly recommend Nelleke's services to anyone who is looking to gain a more compassionate understanding of themselves and their relationships.</p>
